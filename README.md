# beep
A fork of my Windows version of php-sound (originally created by floppydisk05) that instead of playing a sound, it beeps at you
# Instructions
Basically follow the same instructions of my fork of php-sound that runs on Windows, but cut out all of the sound parts or just y'know, figure it out yourself
