# beep
A fork of my Windows version of php-sound (originally created by floppydisk05) that instead of playing a sound, it beeps at you
# Instructions
1. Place the file "beep.exe" somewhere
2. Move all of the files where the "beep.exe" file is
3. Edit index.php to specify where your "annoy.bat", and your "beep.exe" file is (e.g. "change annoy.bat" to "C:\annoy.bat")
4. Move index.php to where all of your web server's documents are contained
5. Done, now go to where the index.php file is and then you should hear a beep come from the server
